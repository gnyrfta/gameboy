Uses Arduino Uno, [joystick](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-joystick) for Arduino and [waveshare 2.4 inch screen](https://www.waveshare.com/2.4inch-lcd-module.htm).

This code is based off the example LCD code that waveshare distributes with its 2.4 inch lcd-screen:

The mandelbrot code and the functions for colouring the graph are based on Filips program:
https://github.com/FilipBerglund/Fractals
Filips program is for c++ and some of the libraries didn't work on arduino, so that makes some parts of the programs 
kind of different.

Complex is an arduino library for Complex math. 
In DEV_Config the baud rate is set to 115200 bit/second, so the serial monitor needs to be set to the same.
